    <p><strong>Games can leverage the testing effect which has been shown to generate greater performance versus tradition studying.  </strong><br><br>
      Frequent recall of learned material or application of patterns strengthen retrieval strength and reduce cognitive load. Gamification of learning has numerous benefits which are best suited to computer-aided delivery. The system can provide instant feedback on correct and incorrect inputs, while serving from a deep pool of question.
<br>
 <br>Game points create an incentive for students to keep coming back and enable 'learning by stealth', especially useful for younger learners who may lack the independence to make good choices about their own practice.

    <p><strong>Rollama is designed to adapt to students' needs as their proficiency increases. </strong>Teachers can track and guide usage to ensure students are getting the most out of the system.

      Fun is not an input for learning but rather an outcome of a good fit between difficulty level and user proficiency. Our games are designed to engage students in a balanced way which does not cause frustration or boredom.

  </h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p><strong>We are not stuffy grammar gatekeepers. We focus on the undisputed fundamentals of clear communication. </strong>English is a living global language with no central authority; it has many parallel varieties with subtly different rules and norms, often depending on style choice, personal preference, or context. Certain rules also change over time; what was once part of Standard English is now side-lined to a Wikipedia dispute thread. This can make some grammar corrections seem fussy or pedantic.
<br><br>
      We love the richness and diversity of spoken English language dialects and colloquialisms. The English language is a complicated mosaic and its grammar perhaps most complicated of all. As English has evolved and absorbed words from other global languages, many of its rules have exceptions and irregular forms. We see no hierarchy of correctness in speech. 
      <br><br>
      However, for successful communication in a global world, Standard English is the most widely accepted form to use when speaking or writing.

    <label for="handle7"><strong> English as an Additional Language</strong></label>
  </h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p><strong>Many languages have significantly different grammar systems which make learning English particularly tricky. Grammar must be explicitly taught and practised if we want our students to attain native-speaker fluency. </strong>
       For example, Mandarin uses no verb tenses or gender pronouns, which means L2 learners often overlook these important aspects of English. The word order of subject-verb-object, and adjective-noun are distinctive from other European languages.
       <br><br>
      Native speakers generally absorb the grammar of their L1 (first language) through usage alone. Some explicit teaching of uncommon or esoteric parts of speech may be necessary, plus some guidance on formal Standard English versus colloquial, informal constructs.         
      <br><br>
      These complexities, dialects and spoken abbreviations can be bewildering for those learning English as an additional language (EAL).      At any age, EAL learners are at a particular disadvantage when school is the only place on which they encounter Standard English. The language of the home, and the playground, provide the 360Â° immersion which native speakers take for granted. 



EAL learners need to know the rules then have sufficient opportunity to practice and notice their errors until automaticity is reached. The mainstream classroom does not appear to provide enough opportunities for this on its own. Hence: Rollama.
